## pets

PETS makes it easy to manage lots of servers running on your machine that you want to keep a close eye on for local development.

### Synopsis

A PETS file is like a Makefile for running servers and connecting them
to other servers. With PETS, we can switch back and forth quickly
between servers running locally and servers running in the cloud.

```
pets [arguments] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -d, --dry-run   just print recommended commands, don't run them
  -h, --help      help for pets
```
